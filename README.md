# extended

This is a library that will aim to help people write safer C programs and extend the functionality that is given by the standard C library. For example this library will make sure that accessing an element in an array out of bounds is taken care of safely or make sure that a pointer given by ’malloc()’ is valid or not or provide data structures like singly linked list. This library should help build other projects quicker and safer.

This project is in very early stages but soon more functionality will be added.
